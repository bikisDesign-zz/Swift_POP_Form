[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bikisDesign/Swift_POP_Form.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bikisDesign/Swift_POP_Form)[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

This is a basic form creation system that uses MVVM and POP to quickly create and customize iOS forms.

It uses [SwiftValidator](https://github.com/SwiftValidatorCommunity/SwiftValidator) and for it's validation.

Here's an article I wrote on the architecture used to create it! [Medium](https://medium.com/@aaron.bikis/coordinators-protocol-oriented-programming-and-mvvm-bullet-proof-architecture-with-swift-629dea5354ce)
